# Micro-RDK (Robot Development Kit for Microcontrollers)

Viam provides an open source robot architecture that provides robotics functionality via simple APIs.

The Micro-RDK is a lightweight version of Viam's [RDK](https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk). Its goal
is to be run on resource-limited embedded systems. The only microcontroller currently supported is
the ESP32.

## (In)stability Notice

> **Warning**
> This is a beta release of the Viam Micro-RDK. Stability is not guaranteed. Breaking changes are likely to occur, and occur often.

## Getting Started

For documentation of the Micro-RDK, see the [Viam Documentation](https://docs.viam.com/installation/microcontrollers/).

## Debugging

### Viewing server logs

The following instructions should be used for viewing server logs from an esp32 in terminal. These logs should be copied and included when contacting Viam support. 

#### Using espflash

To see server logs for an esp32, use the `monitor` command on `espflash`:

```
espflash monitor
```

#### Without espflash

In the event that cargo and/or espflash is not installed, the [micro-rdk-installer](https://github.com/viamrobotics/micro-rdk/tree/main/micro-rdk-installer) also contains the monitor command and can be downloaded as an alternative. 
Here is an example using the x86_64-Linux version:

```
./micro-rdk-installer-amd64-linux monitor
```
